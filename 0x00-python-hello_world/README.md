This is the beginner level of python to be precise the first task on ALX

Task 02
Method: SO basically i just used  the shebang which is (#!/usr/bin/python3), 
to specify the interpreter. And for the final use the PRINT to print out the statement ('"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle')

Task 03
Method: First thing the shebang (#!/usr/bin/python3) then i created a variable which should be "number" and it is should be equivalent to 98, then you should PRINT it out with f-string and a curly braces with the variable in it and the format specifier which is "d" and the remaining string.
