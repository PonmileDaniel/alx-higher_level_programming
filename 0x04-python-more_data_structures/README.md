This basically about Data Structure

1) So for task one we were asked write a function that computes the square value of all integer of a matrix
Soln: first thing write the func which is def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]):
step2: so since we are return a new matrix, we have to create a matrix other than the original one .
so we are to copy to a new matrix
step3: square the matix 
Let see if it would work .

#Task 2
Basically for this is used an if and else statment which return a new_list that the basic foundation of it soln.
